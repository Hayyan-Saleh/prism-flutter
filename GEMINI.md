# Gemini Workspace

This file tracks the work done by the Gemini agent.

## July 12, 2025

- Set up Flutter localization (l10n).
- Externalized hardcoded strings from the following files:
    - `lib/features/account/presentation/pages/account/blocked_accounts_page.dart`
    - `lib/features/account/presentation/pages/notification/notifications_page.dart`
    - `lib/features/account/presentation/widgets/blocked_account_list_tile.dart`
    - `lib/features/account/presentation/widgets/notification_list_tile.dart`
- Created `app_en.arb` for English localizations.
- Updated `main.dart` to include localization delegates.

### July 12, 2025 - 10:30 PM

- Implemented the `getArchivedStatuses` use case.
- Created `get_archived_statuses_usecase.dart`.
- Updated `StatusBloc` to handle the new use case.
- Created `archived_statuses_page.dart` to display archived statuses.
- Added a button to the settings bottom sheet in `home_page.dart` to navigate to the new page.
- Updated `GEMINI.md` to reflect the changes.

## July 14, 2025

- Refactored `archived_statuses_page.dart` to improve UI and user experience.
- Replaced the `PageView` with a `ListView` to display statuses as selectable list tiles.
- Implemented grouping of statuses by timeframes (e.g., "This Week", "This Month").
- Added `FilterChip`s to allow users to filter statuses by day, week, month, and year.
- Added a placeholder action button for a future "create highlight" feature from selected statuses.
- Implemented a full-screen status viewer (`archived_status_viewer_page.dart`) that is opened when a user taps on a status.
- Refined the tap and long-press gestures on the status list to provide a more intuitive UX for selection and viewing.
- Refactored the `archived_status_viewer_page.dart` to use the existing `ShowStatusWidget`, removing the need for a separate `GetStatusByIdUseCase` and `ShowArchivedStatusWidget`.
- Fixed a `Bad state: No element` error in `show_status_widget.dart` by adding a check for an empty list of statuses before accessing it.
- Updated `GEMINI.md` to reflect the changes.
